# password-generator

The password-generator.sh script generates a random password using the length (less than 8) chose by the user.  
The password must contain, __at least__, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number and one special character.

- If you don't know a specific length for your future password, __15__ is __recommended__ to have a strong and complex password.

__Note :__  
The script doesn't need [zenity](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/) package to be used.
